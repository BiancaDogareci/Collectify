## üõ†Ô∏è Architectural Description

### Technologies Used

The architecture of our application that consists of three main components:
- Backend (.NET API)
- Frontend (React Native with Expo)
- Database (Microsoft SQL Server)

### Backend ‚Äì .NET API
.NET provides high performance and scalability, which are essential for handling multiple users and large amounts of data.

Supports RESTful APIs, making communication with the frontend straightforward.

### Frontend ‚Äì React Native with Expo
We chose React Native because it allows cross-platform development, meaning we can write one codebase for both Android and iOS.

We used the Expo framework, as it was recommended on the official site, especially for beginners, because it simplifies the setup and development workflow.

We used UI Kitten, a React Native UI framework, for styling and components because it provides a consistent design system with predefined, customizable UI components and it simplifies development by offering ready-made components like buttons, input fields, lists, reducing the need for custom styling.

### Database ‚Äì Microsoft SQL Server
We used it because it is a relational database that allows efficient structuring of user data, notes, and collections.

It provides strong security features, ensuring that user information and notes are protected.

### How Everything Connects
The user interacts with the React Native app, built with Expo and UI Kitten.

The frontend sends API requests to the .NET backend using JSON/HTTP.

The backend API processes the request, updates the Microsoft SQL Server database, and sends a response.

The frontend updates the UI based on the response, ensuring a seamless user experience.

## ‚úÖ QA
To ensure the reliability and performance of the Collectify app, we implemented a comprehensive testing strategy that includes unit tests, integration tests, performance tests, and manual testing. 

### Testing Methods Used

### 1. Unit Tests

#### üéØ Purpose: 
The unit tests are used to validate the functionality of individual backend components, ensuring that controllers and services work as expected.

#### üìç Location: 
- CollectifyAPI/CollectifyAPI.Tests/ControllersTests;

#### üîç Testing Approach:
Each unit test focused on a single function or method, verifying that it returns the expected results. Key Areas Tested:
- User Authentication: Verifying that login, registration, and token generation function correctly.
- Note Management: Ensuring that notes can be created, updated, deleted, and retrieved properly.
- Group Management: Testing functionalities related to creating, modifying, and deleting groups.

### 2. Integration Tests

#### üéØ Purpose: 
The integration tests verify how multiple components interact, especially API endpoints.

#### üìç Location: 
- CollectifyAPI/CollectifyAPI.Tests/IntegrationTests;

#### üîç Testing Approach:
Key Areas Tested:
- Authentication Handling: Before running tests, ensure users are registered and authenticated, so that only authorized actions are performed.
- CRUD Operations Testing: The tests cover creating, retrieving, updating, and deleting both groups and notes, validating that the API functions correctly.
- Error Handling & Response Validation: Ensures the API returns correct status codes and error messages when encountering invalid or unauthorized requests.

### 4. Manual Tests

#### üéØ Purpose: 
The manual tests helped us identify unexpected failures, UI issues, and usability problems that automated tests might not cover all the time. This helped ensure a smooth user experience and proper error handling across different scenarios.

#### üîç Testing Approach:
We performed a series of test cases by interacting with the application as an end user. The key focus areas included:
- Pressing all buttons to ensure they triggered the correct actions.
- Navigating through different screens to validate UI responsiveness and transitions.
- Entering various inputs, including valid, invalid, and edge-case data, to test form validation and error handling.

#### ‚úÖ Findings and Fixes:
- When adding a new note, the UI did not immediately reflect the update. ‚úÖ
- After navigating to the login page, the back button did not return the user to the home page as expected. ‚úÖ

## üîê Security Analysis

Security is a key aspect of our app to protect user data and prevent unauthorized access. Below are the main security concerns and our solutions:

### 1. Weak Passwords Exploitation

Risk:

Users may set weak passwords that attackers can easily guess through brute-force or dictionary attacks. If an attacker gains access to a user's account, they could manipulate or steal sensitive notes.

Solution:

üí° Enforce minimum password complexity requirements, including:
- At least 8 characters;
- Upper and lowercase letters;
- At least one number and special character;

### 2. Unauthorized Access to Groups
Risk:

Users who are not part of a group or shared space may gain unauthorized access to notes.

Solution:

üí° Implement authentication tokens (JWT - JSON Web Tokens) to verify user identity.

### 3. Server Exposure to External Threats
Risk:

Attackers could try to gain unauthorized access to our backend API or database.

Solution:

üí° Use secure hosting with Nginx as a reverse proxy to filter external requests.

üí° Restrict database access to allow queries only through the backend API, preventing direct external connections.

üí° Encrypt stored notes to add an extra layer of security.

### 4. Network Packet Interception (Man-in-the-Middle Attacks)
Risk:

Attackers could intercept network traffic between the app and the backend, exposing sensitive data.

Solution:

üí° Enforce HTTPS (SSL certificates) for all API requests to encrypt data in transit.

### 5. Unauthorized API Requests
Risk:

Attackers could forge API requests to access or modify data without proper authorization.

Solution:

üí° Implement JWT-based authentication for API requests, including: 
- User ID
- Security key
- Token expiration to prevent replay attacks

üí° Require valid API keys for backend requests.

### Improvements that can be made:

#### 1. Implement the ability to change the password
Current limitations: Users cannot update their passwords after account creation, which is a security risk.

Recommendations: Provide a "Change Password" option in the user profile settings. Also, require authentication before allowing a password change (enter old password + new password).

#### 2. Brute force protection
Current Limitations: Users have no rate limiting for login attempts, making the system vulnerable to brute force attacks.

Recommendations: Implement rate limiting (max 5 attempts per 10 seconds) and introduce temporary account lockout after multiple failed login attempts.

## üîó CI/CD
 
### GitHub Actions Workflow (.NET Backend CI/CD)
We implemented a .NET GitHub Actions workflow (dotnet.yml) to automate the testing process.

#### Features of Our Workflow:
- Runs on push and pull requests to the main branch.
- Supports multiple OS environments (Ubuntu, Windows, macOS).
- Restores, builds, and tests the .NET backend.
- Runs unit and integration tests with logs stored as artifacts.
- Performs performance testing using k6.

### Feature Branch Strategy
We use feature branches to develop specific features independently before merging into main.

Workflow:
- Developers create a new feature branch;
- Code is reviewed through pull requests (PRs) before merging;
- The CI/CD pipeline automatically tests the changes;
- Once approved, the branch is merged into main.
