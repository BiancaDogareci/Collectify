1.	Christiana, medical assistant
Christiana, age 46, is a medical assistant at a clinic in Portugal, where she lives with her husband and their 2 children, ages 21 and 19. She earned her bachelor’s degree at a university in Spain before returning home, where she got her first job at a hospital. After five years there, she decided to switch to a private clinic for a more flexible schedule to spend time with her family.
 Christiana uses technology to stay in touch with her children and for everyday apps that make her life easier, like recipe apps, navigation and scheduling tools. She is interested in using Collectify to share a grocery list with her husband, so that they can keep it updated whenever one of them goes shopping. She might also create a shared wish list with her children, since surprises aren't as important at their ages, and this list helps her stay prepared for birthdays and holidays with gifts they truly want.
2.	Emily, middle-schooler
Emily, age 13, is a middle school student in Manchester, where she lives with her family. She has lived there since birth. Her parents enrolled her in a prestigious school known for its well-structured programs and high expectation. Although her weekdays are busy, she loves spending weekends with her friends, often going to the park.
Even though her parents are programmers,  Emily is more interested in literature, and would like to persue college studies in this field. She has her own phone, but isn’t particularly interested in technology. She might use Collectify to have a shared space with her family, where she can keep track of the materials required for school.
3.	Sophia, High School Student
Sophia, age 17, is a high school student in Lisbon, where she lives with her family. At school, she is a dedicated student with a particular interest in languages and history. She’s considering a career in media or communications, fields that match her love for connecting with others and staying informed. Outside of schoolwork, she is passionate about photography and loves capturing moments with her friends. She is very social and enjoys spending time with her group of friends, whether at school, at the mall, or on weekends. 
Sophia is an active social media user, and technology is a big part of her daily life. She uses her phone to stay connected and keep up with trends. She is interested in using Collectify’s temporary spaces feature for birthday celebrations, to create shared lists with her friends to organize gift ideas and track contributions. Since she only needs these lists for specific occasions, she prefers the flexibility to archive or delete them once the event is over.
